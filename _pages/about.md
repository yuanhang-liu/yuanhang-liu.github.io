Hi! I'm Yuanhang Liu, a Master student in [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) and my major is Robotics. Before that, I got my bachelor degree of Robotics from School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at [China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing](https://www.cumtb.edu.cn/)

My primary research interests focus on Deep learning, Intelligent Robot, Large Language Model(LLM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), especial about Sentiment Analysis.
